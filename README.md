## Notes to hire manager 
I wasn't able to finish implementation for adding cards but I belive I can do it if I had more time and research. I used CSS grids for the cards to make them responsive and automatically get moved to new rows depends on the screen size. For the icons, I used [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) so some icons may look a bit different.
